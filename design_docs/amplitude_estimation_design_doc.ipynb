    "\n",
    "The goal of AE is to approximate the amplitude $a$ of the so-called 'good' states, encoded in an operator A:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A|0> = \\sqrt{1 - a} |\\psi_0> |0> + \\sqrt{a} |\\psi_1> |1>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we set up a secondary operator $Q = A S_0 A^{-1} S_{\\psi_0}$, where $S_0$ flips about the $|0\\rangle$ state and $S_{\\psi_0}$ about the 'bad' state. In principle, providing the $A$ operator suffices to run AE, since we can build $Q$ ourselves by implicitely assuming that the 'good' state is marked by the state $|1\\rangle$ in the last qubit.\n",
    "However, that is a restrictive design and the 'good' state can be far more general. Also, depending on the hardware, we might know a more efficient implementation of S_0 than the default one. That argument also holds for the $Q$ operator, which can in some cases be massively simplified. (ref. Bernoulli A Operator).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we should be able to set the operators $S_0$, $S_{\\psi_0}$ and $Q$ manually. For the $Q$ operator that's currently possible, but we should also allow this for the $S$ operators."

Therefore, algorithms should be able to yield the circuits they execute, let us optimize & execute them to then plug the execution result back into the algorithm. For iterative algorithms this should be possible for every single iteration. This is optional and we may want to choose which iterations are done automatically and which we want to analyze in detail or run manually. Thus, an algorithm should have a state that can be read and set as appropriate combined with a method to run a single iteration given the state."
